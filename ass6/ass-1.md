**Q.1 What’s Constructor And Its Purpose?**

Solution--->

Constructor is an essential component in object-oriented programming used to initialize objects of a class. It is invoked during the creation of an instance (object) of a class and is responsible for setting up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its member variables or performing necessary initialization operations.

The primary purpose of a constructor is to ensure that an object is in a valid and usable state before it is utilized. By providing the necessary initialization logic, constructors allow objects to be properly prepared for subsequent operations.

Initialization: Constructors facilitate the initialization of member variables within an object, enabling the assignment of initial values.

Absence of return type: Constructors do not possess a return type, including "void." They focus solely on object initialization rather than returning values.

Overloading: Similar to other methods, constructors can be overloaded. This means that multiple constructors can be defined within a class, each accepting a different set of parameters. This flexibility enables diverse approaches to object initialization.

Default constructor: In situations where no constructors are explicitly defined, many programming languages automatically generate a default constructor. This default constructor either assigns default values to the object or performs no operations if initialization is unnecessary.

Initialization order: Certain programming languages utilize constructors to manage the order in which member variables are initialized. This ensures appropriate handling of dependencies between variables.

**Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?**

Solution--->

The `this` keyword is a special element in several programming languages, including JavaScript, designed to reference the current instance of an object. It is primarily used within the scope of an object to access its properties and methods. The purpose of the `this` keyword is to offer a convenient way to specifically denote the object on which a method is being invoked or from which a property is being accessed.

1. Current object reference: When a method is called on an object, the `this` keyword within that method refers to the object itself. This enables the method to interact with and modify the object's properties, as well as invoke other associated methods.

2. Dynamic resolution: The value of the `this` keyword is dynamically resolved during runtime, depending on how the method is invoked. This flexibility allows the same method to operate on different objects, adapting its behavior based on the specific calling context.

3. Usage in constructor functions: In JavaScript, the `this` keyword is widely utilized within constructor functions to refer to the newly created object. It enables the constructor to assign values to the object's properties and execute necessary initialization steps.

4. Event handlers and callbacks: In event-driven programming paradigms, such as JavaScript's event system, the `this` keyword is commonly employed to refer to the object that triggered the event or executed the callback function.

5. Explicit binding: JavaScript also provides explicit methods like `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` to explicitly bind the `this` keyword to a particular object. This allows fine-grained control over the execution context of a function and ensures that `this` references the intended object.

**Q.3 What’s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them**

Solution--->

The `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods are integral features in JavaScript that allow for the manipulation of the `this` keyword and provide control over the execution context of a function.

1. `call()` method:
   - Syntax: `functionName.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
   - The `call()` method executes a function and explicitly sets the value of `this` inside the function to the provided `thisArg`.
   - Additional arguments can be passed individually after `thisArg` and will be passed to the function as separate arguments.
   - The `call()` method is typically employed when the function arguments are known in advance and need to be passed individually.

2. `apply()` method:
   - Syntax: `functionName.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])`
   - The `apply()` method executes a function and explicitly sets the value of `this` inside the function to the provided `thisArg`.
   - Arguments are passed as an array-like object or an actual array using the `argsArray` parameter.
   - The `apply()` method is commonly used when the function arguments are stored in an array or array-like object.

3. `bind()` method:
   - Syntax: `functionName.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`
   - The `bind()` method returns a new function that has the same function body as the original function but with `this` explicitly set to the provided `thisArg`.
   - Additional arguments can be passed to `bind()`, which will be prepended to the arguments passed to the bound function when it is invoked.
   - Unlike `call()` and `apply()`, the `bind()` method does not immediately execute the function but instead creates a new function with the desired bound context for later invocation.

  ** **Q.4 Explain OOPS ? ****

Solution--->

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes structuring code around objects and their interactions. In JavaScript, which is primarily a prototype-based language, OOP concepts can still be applied. Here's a brief explanation of OOP in JavaScript:

1. Objects: In JavaScript, objects are instances of classes or prototypes. They encapsulate data (properties) and behaviors (methods) into a single entity. Objects can be created using the `new` keyword or object literals (`{}`).

2. Classes: Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), the `class` keyword allows the creation of classes in JavaScript. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. It acts as a constructor function and can be used to instantiate multiple object instances.

3. Inheritance: JavaScript supports inheritance through the prototype chain. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, forming a hierarchical relationship. Prototypal inheritance enables code reuse and sharing of behavior between objects.

4. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data and related methods within an object, limiting direct access to the internal state. JavaScript provides ways to define public and private members within objects, controlling their visibility and access.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass or interface. JavaScript achieves polymorphism through dynamic typing and duck typing, enabling flexibility and adaptable code.

6. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing essential features while hiding unnecessary complexities. In JavaScript, objects, classes, and interfaces can be used to achieve abstraction, providing simplified and high-level concepts.

7. Object Composition: JavaScript promotes object composition, where objects can be composed of other objects to achieve complex functionalities. This approach allows for flexible object structures and modular design.

**Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?**

Solution--->

Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. Its primary goal is to provide a high-level representation or interface that allows users to interact with objects or systems without being burdened by internal complexities.

The purpose of abstraction is to create models or representations that capture the core aspects of real-world entities or systems, without exposing the intricacies of their implementation. By abstracting away the implementation details, abstraction promotes code modularity, reusability, and adaptability.

1. Essential feature focus: Abstraction filters out non-essential details and emphasizes the most critical characteristics of an object or system. It identifies the fundamental properties, behaviors, and interactions that are relevant to solving a particular problem.

2. Concealing implementation specifics: Abstraction hides the inner workings and complexities of an object or system. It provides a simplified interface or set of methods that enable users to interact with the object without needing to understand its internal implementation.

3. Modularity and reusability: By abstracting implementation details, code can be organized into modular components. These components can be reused in various contexts, promoting code reusability and reducing redundant code.

4. Complexity encapsulation: Abstraction encapsulates complex functionality within an object or system, shielding users from unnecessary complexity. Users can interact with the object through a well-defined interface, abstracting away the intricate implementation specifics.

5. Simplified comprehension and maintenance: Abstraction provides a higher-level understanding of an object or system, making it easier to comprehend and maintain. Developers can work with abstract concepts and interact with objects without requiring in-depth knowledge of every internal component.

**Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?**

Solution--->

Polymorphism is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a shared superclass or interface. Its purpose is to enhance code flexibility and reusability by providing a consistent interface to handle objects with varying behaviors and characteristics.

The primary goal of polymorphism is to promote code modularity and adaptability. It allows different objects to respond differently to the same method call based on their specific implementations. Polymorphism allows developers to work with objects at a higher level of abstraction, irrespective of their exact types or internal details.

1. Method overriding: Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. When a method is called on an object, the overridden method in the subclass is invoked instead of the superclass method, facilitating dynamic behavior.

2. Interface compatibility: Polymorphism can also be attained through interface implementation. Multiple classes can implement the same interface, enabling them to be used interchangeably by code that relies on that interface. This promotes code modularity and allows objects of different classes to be seamlessly utilized.

3. Dynamic dispatch: Polymorphic method calls are resolved at runtime using dynamic dispatch. The appropriate method implementation is determined based on the actual object type, allowing for dynamic behavior and adaptability.

4. Code extensibility: Polymorphism simplifies code extensibility by enabling the addition of new classes to a program without modifying existing code that depends on the shared interface or superclass. Existing code can work with new object types as long as they adhere to the agreed-upon interface or superclass contract.

5. Code flexibility and reuse: Polymorphism enhances code flexibility by enabling objects to exhibit different behaviors while adhering to a common interface or superclass. It promotes code reuse by allowing a single piece of code to operate on multiple object types, minimizing redundancy and improving maintainability.

**Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?**

Solution--->

Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables objects to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class or superclass. It fosters code reusability, facilitates modular code design, and establishes hierarchical relationships among classes.

1. Class hierarchy: Inheritance establishes a hierarchical structure where subclasses (derived classes) inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class (base class or superclass). This hierarchical relationship can be extended to multiple levels, forming a tree-like structure.

2. Code reuse: Inheritance facilitates code reuse by allowing subclasses to inherit and utilize code from their parent class. This eliminates the need for redundant code and improves code maintenance. Changes made to the parent class automatically propagate to its subclasses.

3. Overriding and extension: Subclasses can override inherited methods from the superclass, providing their own implementations to meet specific requirements. This allows customization and extension of inherited behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface defined by the superclass.

4. Inherited attributes: Subclasses inherit the properties and attributes (member variables) of the superclass, enabling them to access and utilize the inherited data. This promotes code reuse and modular design.

5. Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely associated with polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a shared superclass or interface. This flexibility enhances code adaptability and enables dynamic behavior.

**Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?**

Solution--->

Encapsulation is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data and related methods within a single entity called an object. It focuses on data protection and controlled access by limiting direct interaction with the internal state of an object. The primary purpose of encapsulation is to enhance code maintainability, promote information hiding, and ensure data integrity.

1. Data protection: Encapsulation shields the internal state of an object from unauthorized access or modification. By encapsulating data, it prevents direct manipulation and ensures that data is accessed and modified only through well-defined methods.

2. Interfaces for interaction: Encapsulation provides public interfaces, typically methods, through which external code can interact with an object. These interfaces serve as controlled access points to manipulate the encapsulated data, enforcing validation and maintaining consistency.

3. Information hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of an object, exposing only the necessary information and functionality. It separates the external interface from the internal workings, reducing dependencies and improving code maintainability.

4. Code organization and modularity: Encapsulation promotes code organization by grouping related data and behavior into cohesive objects. It enables modular design, allowing objects to be developed and modified independently. This enhances code reusability, scalability, and facilitates collaborative development.

5. Levels of encapsulation: Encapsulation can involve different levels of access control, such as public, private, and protected. Public members are accessible from anywhere, private members are restricted to the object itself, and protected members are accessible within the object and its subclasses.

6. Connection to OOP principles: Encapsulation is closely tied to other OOP principles like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. It supports abstraction by hiding unnecessary details, enables proper inheritance by controlling access to superclass members, and ensures consistent behavior for polymorphic objects.

**Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?**

Solution--->

In JavaScript, a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to facilitate object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript.

1. Class declaration: Classes are declared using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. For example, `class MyClass { }` declares a class named `MyClass`.

2. Constructor method: Within a class, the `constructor` method is a special method used to initialize objects created from the class. It is automatically invoked when a new object is instantiated from the class.

3. Properties and methods: Class members, including properties and methods, are defined within the class body. Properties represent the data or state of an object, while methods define the behavior or actions that objects can perform.

4. Object instantiation: Objects are created from a class using the `new` keyword followed by the class name and parentheses. For example, `let obj = new MyClass();` creates a new object `obj` based on the `MyClass` class.

5. Inheritance: JavaScript classes support inheritance through the `extends` keyword. Subclasses can be created by extending a base class, inheriting its properties and methods. The `super` keyword is used to call the superclass's constructor and access its methods.

6. Prototype-based nature: JavaScript's class implementation is based on prototypes. Each class and its instances have an associated prototype object, which enables inheritance and sharing of behavior.

**Q.10 What’s Super Keyword & What it does?**

Solution--->

The `super` keyword in JavaScript is utilized to invoke functions or access properties of a parent class from within a subclass. It plays a crucial role in referencing and calling the constructor, methods, and properties of the superclass.

1. Invoking the superclass's constructor: Within the constructor of a subclass, the `super()` function is employed to call the constructor of the parent class. This ensures that the subclass inherits and initializes the properties defined in the superclass. It is important to note that the `super()` call must be made before accessing `this` within the subclass's constructor.

2. Accessing the superclass's methods: The `super` keyword allows the subclass to invoke methods defined in the parent class. By utilizing `super.methodName()`, the subclass can call and override the methods of the parent class while still retaining access to their original functionality.

3. Accessing the superclass's properties: Similarly, the `super` keyword provides access to the properties defined in the parent class. Through `super.propertyName`, the subclass can refer to and modify the inherited properties from the superclass.

4. Usage in static methods: The `super` keyword can also be used in static methods to reference the static methods or properties of the superclass. This enables subclasses to access and override the static members of the parent class.
