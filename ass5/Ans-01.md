**//Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?**

//Solution--->

Synchronous and asynchronous are two different programming paradigms used to handle tasks and operations in software development. Let's explore the key differences between synchronous and asynchronous approaches:

1. Synchronous:
In synchronous programming, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other, in a blocking manner. When a synchronous task is initiated, the program waits until that task is completed before moving on to the next task. The execution flow is predictable and follows a strict order.

In this approach, if a task takes a long time to execute or gets blocked, it can significantly slow down the entire program, as subsequent tasks are held up until the current task finishes.

Example:
console.log('Task 1');
console.log('Task 2');
console.log('Task 3');

2. Asynchronous:
Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to be initiated without waiting for each task to complete before moving on to the next one. Instead of blocking the execution flow, asynchronous tasks are handled concurrently, and the program continues its execution without interruptions.

Asynchronous operations often involve the use of callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax to handle the completion or errors of tasks. This enables better resource utilization and responsiveness, as the program can perform other operations while waiting for the completion of asynchronous tasks.

Example:
console.log('Task 1');
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Task 2');
}, 2000);
console.log('Task 3');

In the above example, Task 1 is executed first, followed by Task 3. The setTimeout function is an asynchronous operation that delays the execution of Task 2 by 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). Meanwhile, the program continues executing other tasks without waiting for the delay to complete.

**//Q.2 Explain Web Apis**

//Solution--->

Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in JavaScript refer to a collection of functionalities and methods provided by web browsers. These APIs allow developers to interact with various aspects of the web platform, enabling them to create dynamic and interactive web applications. Below are some key Web APIs in JavaScript:

1. DOM API (Document Object Model):
The DOM API enables developers to manipulate HTML and XML documents dynamically. It provides methods and properties to access, modify, and create elements, handle events, change styles, and update the content of web pages.

2. XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API:
These APIs facilitate making HTTP requests from the browser. The XMLHttpRequest API (commonly used in older browsers) and the Fetch API (introduced in newer browsers) allow developers to retrieve data from servers asynchronously. This enables tasks such as fetching data from APIs and updating web content without needing to refresh the entire page.

3. Geolocation API:
The Geolocation API allows web applications to retrieve the user's geographical location if the user grants permission. It provides methods to access latitude, longitude, altitude, and other location-related information. This API is commonly used in location-aware web applications, mapping services, and location-based features.

4. Web Storage API:
The Web Storage API, consisting of localStorage and sessionStorage, provides a way to store data on the client-side. It allows developers to store key-value pairs persistently (localStorage) or temporarily (sessionStorage) within the user's browser. This is useful for caching data, storing user preferences, and maintaining session-specific information.

5. Canvas API:
The Canvas API offers a powerful 2D drawing context that allows developers to generate and manipulate graphics, images, and animations dynamically. It provides methods for drawing shapes, paths, text, and images on a canvas element, enabling the creation of interactive charts, games, and visualizations.

6. Web Audio API:
The Web Audio API enables audio processing and manipulation in web applications. It provides a set of JavaScript objects and methods for creating, controlling, and manipulating audio sources, applying audio effects, and managing audio playback.

//**Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval**

//Solution--->

setTimeout():
The setTimeout() function in JavaScript allows you to schedule the execution of a function or a code snippet after a specified delay. It takes two parameters: a callback function or code snippet to execute, and a delay time in milliseconds.

setTimeout(callback, delay);

Parameters:

callback: The function or code snippet to be executed after the delay.
delay: The time delay (in milliseconds) before the execution of the callback.

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Delayed message');
}, 2000);


setInterval():
The setInterval() function allows you to repeatedly execute a function or a code snippet at a specified time interval. It also takes two parameters: a callback function or code snippet to execute, and an interval time in milliseconds.

Syntax:
setInterval(callback, interval);

Parameters:

callback: The function or code snippet to be repeatedly executed.
interval: The time interval (in milliseconds) between each execution of the callback.

setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Repeated message');
}, 1000);

**//Q.4 What are the ways we have to handle Async Code in JS?**

//Solution--->

Callbacks:
Callbacks are a traditional way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. With this approach, you pass a function as a callback to an asynchronous function. When the operation completes, the callback function is invoked to process the result or handle any errors.

Example:
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = 'Some data';
    callback(null, data); // Call the callback with the result
  }, 2000);
}

// Usage
fetchData((error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Result:', result);
  }
});

Promises:
Promises provide a more structured and readable approach to handle asynchronous code. A Promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows chaining operations using .then() and .catch() to handle successful and failed outcomes, respectively.

Example:
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Some data';
      resolve(data); // Resolve the promise with the result
      // or reject(new Error('Error message')) for error handling
    }, 2000);
  });
}

// Usage
fetchData()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('Result:', result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });

Async/await:
Async/await is a modern syntax introduced in ES2017 (ES8) that simplifies handling asynchronous code. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and synchronous-like manner, enhancing code readability.

Example:
async function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Some data';
      resolve(data); // Resolve the promise with the result
      // or reject(new Error('Error message')) for error handling
    }, 2000);
  });
}

// Usage
async function main() {
  try {
    const result = await fetchData();
    console.log('Result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

main();

**//Q.5 What are Callbacks & Explain Callback Hell ?**

//Solution--->

Callbacks in JavaScript refer to functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed later, usually after an asynchronous operation or a certain event occurs. They allow you to define the behavior that should happen after a particular operation completes. Callbacks enable asynchronous programming, where code execution continues while waiting for certain operations to finish.

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, is a term used to describe a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callbacks are used, leading to code that becomes difficult to read, understand, and maintain. This situation arises when there are multiple asynchronous operations that depend on the results of previous operations, resulting in deeply nested callback functions.

Example of callback hell:
asyncOperation1((error1, result1) => {
  if (error1) {
    console.error('Error:', error1);
  } else {
    asyncOperation2(result1, (error2, result2) => {
      if (error2) {
        console.error('Error:', error2);
      } else {
        asyncOperation3(result2, (error3, result3) => {
          if (error3) {
            console.error('Error:', error3);
          } else {
            // ...and so on
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});

In the above example, there are multiple async operations (asyncOperation1, asyncOperation2, asyncOperation3, etc.) that depend on the results of previous operations. Each operation is passed a callback function to handle the result or error. As more operations are added, the code becomes deeply nested and difficult to follow, leading to maintenance issues, code duplication, and decreased readability.

To mitigate callback hell, several approaches have been introduced, such as using Promises, async/await, or modularizing code with named functions. These techniques provide better code organization, readability, and error handling, making asynchronous code easier to write and maintain.

Using Promises, the example above can be rewritten as:
asyncOperation1()
  .then((result1) => {
    return asyncOperation2(result1);
  })
  .then((result2) => {
    return asyncOperation3(result2);
  })
  .then((result3) => {
    // ...and so on
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });

Here, Promises allow chaining of operations using .then(), making the code more readable and avoiding excessive nesting. The .catch() method is used to handle any errors that occur during the asynchronous operations.

Alternatively, with async/await:
async function performAsyncOperations() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncOperation1();
    const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
    const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
    // ...and so on
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

performAsyncOperations();

In this example, the performAsyncOperations() function uses the await keyword to pause the execution until each asynchronous operation completes. The try...catch block is used to handle any errors that occur during the operations.

**//Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Method of Promise**

//Solution--->

Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. They provide a structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code. Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. When a Promise is pending, the asynchronous operation is ongoing. When it is fulfilled, the operation is successfully completed, and when it is rejected, an error occurs.

Promises offer several methods to interact with and handle asynchronous operations. Here are three important Promise methods:

1. then():
The then() method is used to handle the fulfillment of a Promise. It takes two optional callback functions as arguments: onFulfilled and onRejected. The onFulfilled callback is executed when the Promise is fulfilled (resolved), and the onRejected callback is executed when the Promise is rejected.

Example:
fetchData()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('Fulfilled:', result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Rejected:', error);
  });

2. catch():
The catch() method is used to handle the rejection of a Promise. It takes a single onRejected callback function as an argument. It is equivalent to calling then(null, onRejected). The catch() method is commonly used to handle errors or exceptions that occur during the Promise chain.

Example:
fetchData()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('Fulfilled:', result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Rejected:', error);
  });

3. finally():
The finally() method is used to specify a callback function that will be executed regardless of whether the Promise is fulfilled or rejected. This method is useful for performing cleanup operations or releasing resources after an asynchronous operation completes, regardless of its outcome.

Example:
fetchData()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log('Fulfilled:', result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Rejected:', error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log('Cleanup operations');
  });

**//Q.7 Whatâ€™s Async & Await Keyword in JavaScript**

//Solution--->

Async and await keywords are part of the ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) update, providing a more readable and simplified syntax for working with Promises and handling asynchronous operations.

The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. When a function is marked as async, it automatically returns a Promise. This enables you to use the await keyword within the function to pause the execution and wait for a Promise to resolve before proceeding further.

On the other hand, the await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is fulfilled and to retrieve the resolved value of the Promise. When await is used with a Promise, it allows you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and synchronous-like manner, enhancing code readability.

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Some data';
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function main() {
  try {
    const result = await fetchData();
    console.log('Result:', result);
    // Other sequential operations...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

main();

In the above example, the fetchData() function returns a Promise that resolves after a 2-second delay. The main() function is defined as an async function and utilizes the await keyword to pause its execution until the Promise returned by fetchData() is fulfilled. Once the Promise is resolved, the value is assigned to the result variable, and subsequent operations can be executed sequentially.

**//Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch block**

//Solution--->

The purpose of the try and catch blocks in JavaScript is to handle errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of code.

The try block is used to enclose a section of code where an error or exception might occur. It allows you to define a block of code that you want to monitor for any exceptions. If an exception occurs within the try block, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the control is transferred to the catch block.

The catch block is used to define the actions that should be taken when an exception is thrown within the corresponding try block. It specifies the code that will be executed to handle the exception and provides an opportunity to gracefully handle errors. The catch block takes an error object as a parameter, which contains information about the exception that was thrown.

Example:-

try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
  const result = someFunction();
  console.log('Result:', result);
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the exception
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
}

In the above example, the try block contains the code that may throw an exception. If an exception occurs during the execution of someFunction(), the control is transferred to the catch block. The error object is caught and can be accessed within the catch block, allowing you to log the error message or perform any necessary error handling.

**//Q.9 Whats fetch in JavaScript?**

//Solution--->

In JavaScript, the fetch() function is a built-in API that enables making asynchronous HTTP requests and interacting with web resources. It offers a straightforward and flexible way to fetch data from a specified URL.

When invoked with a URL, fetch() returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object representing the response to the request. The Response object contains various methods and properties to access and process the response data.

Example:-

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Error: ' + response.status);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Data:', data);
    // Process the retrieved data
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });

In the above example, fetch() is used to initiate a GET request to the URL 'https://api.example.com/data'. The resulting Promise is then chained with a then() method to handle the response. The first then() block checks if the response was successful (response.ok). If it is not, an error is thrown. When the response is successful, the json() method is used to extract and parse the response data as JSON. The second then() block receives the parsed data, allowing you to further process it according to your requirements. In case any errors occur during the fetch or response handling, the catch() block is executed to handle and log the error.

**//Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?**

//Solution--->

To define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async and await, you can simply prepend the async keyword before the function declaration. This informs JavaScript that the function contains asynchronous operations and will always return a Promise.

Example:-
async function fetchData() {
  // Asynchronous code goes here
  // For instance, fetching data from an API
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

In the above example, the fetchData() function is declared as an asynchronous function using the async keyword. Within this function, you can write code that involves asynchronous operations. In this case, it utilizes the fetch() function to make an HTTP request and retrieve data from 'https://api.example.com/data'.

The await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by fetch() resolves and the response is available. By employing await, you can write code in a more sequential and synchronous-like style, enhancing readability.

In the example, await is used twice: first to await the resolution of the fetch() Promise and assign the resulting response object, and then to await the resolution of the response.json() Promise and assign the parsed data.

Finally, the function returns the fetched data as a Promise. Since an async function always returns a Promise, you can use it with then() or await when invoking the function.

Example:-

fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('Fetched data:', data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });

In this above example, the fetchData() function is called, and the returned Promise is handled using the then() method. The fetched data is then logged to the console. If any errors occur during the execution of the async function, they are caught and handled in the catch() block.
